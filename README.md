## Introduction
<p align="justify">
   This Vector 2D class is a powerful tool for handling algebraic vectors in your projects. 
It provides a comprehensive set of operations and functionalities to perform common vector calculations efficiently.
</p>

## Description
<p align="justify">
   When working with vectors in programming, there is often the challenge of updating the vector's coordinates while simultaneously updating its magnitude and direction. Typically, this is done using Get and Set functions, but these functions are needed for each coordinate of the vector. <br>
   On the other hand, C# benefits from properties, which allow modifying the value of a field and performing actions as mentioned before. However, these features are not present in C++. <br> 
   That's why I built this Vector class, which includes another private class called Coordinate. Coordinate has a floating-point member variable that serves as a reference to store the coordinate value on the Vector side (I know it sounds tricky, but it might become clearer when looking at the code). Additionally, the = operator is overridden in the Coordinate class, so when updating the value of a coordinate, the magnitude and direction of the vector are also updated.  <br>
   With this class, you can confidently update the value of one of its coordinates using the = operator without worrying, as it will automatically update the magnitude and direction at that moment. <br>
</p>

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Vector2.h"

int main() {
    // Create two vectors
    Vector2 v1(3, 4); // Its magnitude is 5 ( sqrt(9 + 16) )
    v1.x = 1; // At this point its magnitude is 4.12311
    v1.y = 1; // Now its magnitude is 1.41421, since sqrt( (1 * 1) + (1 * 1) ) => sqrt(2)
}
```

## Getting Started

To begin using the Vector2CplusplusClass in your C++ project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yunrock/Vector2CplusplusClass.git
   ```

2. Include the necessary header file in your project:

   ```cpp
   #include "Vector2.h"
   ```

3. Compile your project with the Vector2CplusplusClass source files.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Vector2CplusplusClass:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Vector2.h"

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main() {
    // Create two vectors
    Vector2 v1(3, 4);
    Vector2 v2(-2, 5);
    
    // Update them 
    v1.x = -9;
    v2.x = 5;
    
    // Perform operations
    v1.normalize();
    v2.rotate(45);
    Vector2 sumVector = v1 + v2;
    Vector2 differenceVector = v1 - v2;
    Vector2 scaledVector = v1 * 2;
    float dotProduct = Vector2::dotProduct(v1, v2);
    float crossProduct = Vector2::crossProduct(v1, v2);
    bool areEqual = v1 == v2;

    // Print results
    cout << v1.magnitude() << "\n";
    cout << v2.direction() << "\n";
    cout << "Sum Vector: " << sumVector << "\n";
    cout << "Difference Vector: " << differenceVector << "\n";
    cout << "Scaled Vector: " << scaledVector << "\n";
    cout << "Normalized Vector: " << normalizedVector << "\n";
    cout << "Dot Product: " << dotProduct << "\n";
    cout << "Cross Product: " << crossProduct << "\n";
    cout << "Equality Check: " << std::boolalpha << areEqual << "\n";

}
```
